# **Writing emails to professors**


- time (which weekday you email and how early you email in accordance to the start time of the research internship)

- subject of email -- be specific like "2015 Propspective Research Intern for xyz subject area"

- body of mail: Do some background research and homework - run through the body of work the professor has done, select one publication or project that overlaps with your interest and READ IT. Come up with some interesting insight or query about it. Donâ€™t be vague, use technical words. Try to add your own ideas. Nothing proves your interest more than actually doing your homework.

# **Resume**
- give technical details under projects & experiences
- don't give generic descriptions
- list the skills you are good at first
- first hard skills then soft

# **Cover Letter Email**
- **Subject of email:**
  - application for internship -- iit delhi, b.tech computer science
  - internship application -- web developer

- **Content:**
  - who are you and what is the purpose of writing this cover letter
  - why are you interested in this role?
  - why should you be hired for this role?

- **Signature:**
  - include it with all details

# **Portfolio**
- allows you to show your skill set
- Portfolios need not always just be a compilation of your work samples.
- You can also craft compelling stories about your work samples by sharing the reason you chose to work on a particular project, tools used by you to implement it successfully, challenges you faced & how you overcame them, and your reason to share that work sample in your portfolio.
- This can tell the employers a lot about your working style and gives them a chance to learn more about you as a professional.


**LinkedIn**


- use a formal picture of yourself in which your face is clearly visible (adds a lot of credibility to your profile)
- concise and descriptive headline
- education background, what role you want to work as.. for example: A B.Ed. graduate looking for teaching internships and jobs
- detailed description about work experience (you can also copy paste what is in your resume)
  - **For projects**, some things to mention are responsibilities, duration of the project
  - **For internships/volunteer work**, some things to mention are the profile name, organization and the duration you worked for
  - Here is a sample:

- include specific keywords
  - recruiters usually find candidates by searching for keywords relevant to the job profile for which they are recruiting.
    - For example: A web developer profile can include words such as backend, frontend, database management, etc.
    - Another example: For a content writing profile, keywords such as SEO, proofreading, grammar, etc. will be helpful
    - one way you can find such keywords is by reading job descriptions relevant to the profile you are looking for

- build a professional connection on linkedin
  - send them connection requests
  - whenever you send a connection request, write a personalized note stating the purpose for you to connect
  - For example:
  <img src="/notes/assets/intern&jobs/Sample networking connect message.png" />

  - if anyone in your network works in the company you are interested in, then you can take their help in finding out if they have any job openings or if they can refer you for some job opening in that company
  - on linkedin, you can even reach out to potential employers/hiring managers through a personal message and by sharing about the opportunities you are seeking

  - mention all your educations details, courses, projects, work experiences, languages known to you, etc.
