Relational databases make it easy form relations between databases. Its a more efficient form of storage.
SQL is language designed entirely for accessing databases and is most the popular of them. 

Creating a table and inserting data

{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);
/** In databases we need a unique identifier because other column values could change but the primary key will remain unique and same. Hence the column id as primary key **/

INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Peanut Butter", 1, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (3, "Dark chocolate bars", 2, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (4, "Ice Cream", 3, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (5, "Figs", 5, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (6, "Bread", 1, 1);
{% endhighlight %}

Querying the table
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT * FROM groceries; /** Displays the whole table **/

SELECT * FROM groceries ORDER BY aisle; /** displays the table in ascending order of the aisle values **/

SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE aisle > 5 ORDER BY aisle; /** Same as before, except it will display only the rows where aisle is greater than 5 **/
{% endhighlight %}

Aggregating data
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries; /** With the aggregator feature you can do max, min, sum, and average **/

SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle; /** It will add all the number of items in each aisle **/

SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle; /** Displays aisle wise sum along with which aisle each sum belongs to **/
{% endhighlight %}
