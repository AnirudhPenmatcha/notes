Relational databases make it easy to form relations between databases. It's a more efficient form of storage.
SQL is language designed entirely for accessing databases and is the most popular of them.

Creating a table and inserting data

{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);
/** In databases we need a unique identifier because other column values could change but the primary key will remain unique and same. Hence the column id as primary key **/

INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Peanut Butter", 1, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (3, "Dark chocolate bars", 2, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (4, "Ice Cream", 3, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (5, "Figs", 5, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (6, "Bread", 1, 1);
{% endhighlight %}

Querying the table
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT * FROM groceries; /** Displays the whole table **/

SELECT * FROM groceries ORDER BY aisle; /** displays the table in ascending order of the aisle values **/

SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE aisle > 5 ORDER BY aisle; /** Same as before, except it will display only the rows where aisle is greater than 5 **/
{% endhighlight %}

Aggregating data
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries; /** With the aggregator feature you can do max, min, sum, and average **/

SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle; /** It will add all the number of items in each aisle **/

SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle; /** Displays aisle wise sum along with which aisle each sum belongs to **/
{% endhighlight %}

In SQL, you can set a column to autoincrement and input values only to the columns you would like to
{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE TABLE exercise_logs
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER,
    calories INTEGER,
    heart_rate INTEGER);
{% endhighlight %}
In the above code, id is set to autoincrement. Now we needn't worry about id and only input values to other columns like so:
{% highlight ruby %}
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 30, 100, 110);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 10, 30, 105);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("dancing", 15, 200, 120);
{% endhighlight %}
When you are querying you can also give conditions with AND, OR (AND has precedence over OR but you can mainpulate the order of execution with parenthesis)
{% highlight ruby %}
/* AND */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 AND minutes < 30;

/* OR */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 OR heart_rate > 100;
{% endhighlight %}
Suppose I want to select all rows where activity type is an outdoor sport
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type = "biking" OR type = "hiking" OR type = "tree climbing" OR type = "rowing";
{% endhighlight %}
But SQL makes your life easier by using an operator called "IN"
{% highlight ruby %}
/* IN */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN ("biking", "hiking", "tree climbing", "rowing");
{% endhighlight %}
We can do something called as querying in subqueries where basically there is a query within a query
{% highlight ruby %}
/* Creating and inserting values into a table */
CREATE TABLE drs_favorites
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    reason TEXT);

INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("biking", "Improves endurance and flexibility.");
INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("hiking", "Increases cardiovascular health.");
{% endhighlight %}
Now what I can do is display all the rows from exercise_logs table where the sport is one which recommended by the doctor
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN ("biking", "hiking");
{% endhighlight %}
But the problem here is if doctor recommends more sports then our select statement won't be dynamic. So now we can try a query inside a query
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites);

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason = "Increases cardiovascular health.");
{% endhighlight %}
One very useful feature from SQL to make your life easy is "LIKE".
With LIKE you can simply use specific keywords that can appear in text and SQL will find out if the sentence contains that word
{% highlight ruby %}
/* LIKE */

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE "%cardiovascular%");
{% endhighlight %}
It also helps if you don't want to worry about your search term being exactly same as what you are looking for

We can rename a column using AS
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT type, SUM(calories) AS total_calories FROM exercise_logs GROUP BY type;
{% endhighlight %}

The WHERE condition can confuse things up when using GROUP BY. So for such cases using HAVING solves it.
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT type, SUM(calories) AS total_calories FROM exercise_logs
    GROUP BY type
    HAVING total_calories > 150;

SELECT type, AVG(calories) AS avg_calories FROM exercise_logs
    GROUP BY type
    HAVING avg_calories > 70;
{% endhighlight %}

Using the CASE command
Suppose you want to categorize the values then with CASE you can do that. This somewhat resembles if else statements
{% highlight ruby %}
/* CASE */
SELECT type, heart_rate,
    CASE
        WHEN heart_rate > 220-30 THEN "above max"
        WHEN heart_rate > ROUND(0.90 * (220-30)) THEN "above target"
        WHEN heart_rate > ROUND(0.50 * (220-30)) THEN "within target"
        ELSE "below target"
    END as "hr_zone"
FROM exercise_logs;
{% endhighlight %}
